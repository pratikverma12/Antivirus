# Antivirus
Antivirus Creation 

Overview
This is a simple antivirus scanner project developed in Python using the Tkinter library for the user interface. The antivirus scanner checks for a predefined virus signature in selected files and notifies the user if a potential threat is detected.

Files
antivirus.py: Contains the core functionality for file scanning.
antivirus_frontend.py: Implements the Tkinter-based graphical user interface for the antivirus scanner.

How to Use
Run the antivirus_frontend.py script to launch the antivirus scanner application.
Click on the "Open File" button to select a file for scanning.
The application will display whether a virus is found in the selected file or if it is clean.

Virus Signature (private)
The virus signature used for scanning is: X50!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$PRATIK-VERMA-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually included in standard Python installations)

Project Structure
The antivirus.py file contains the backend logic for scanning files.
The antivirus_frontend.py file implements the graphical user interface using Tkinter.
The center_window function is used to center the application window on the screen.

Notes
This project is for educational purposes and may not provide comprehensive antivirus protection.
The virus signature used in this project is a placeholder and should be replaced with a real signature for practical use.
